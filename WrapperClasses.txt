Java is Object oriented programming language. At the other hand it also 
works with Primitive Datatypes. But to make the value fully functional in
object oriented format Java has a veriety of various classes for 
data convrsion. We call it as Wrapper Class

1. int     -> Integer
2. double  -> Double
3. short   -> Short
4. float   -> Float
5. boolean -> Boolean
6. long    -> Long
7. char    -> Character
....

All wrapper classes belong to java.lang package.

Why do we use wrapper?
 1. To store the objects in multiple quantity where non primitives are required.
 2. Data Manipulation - to maintain proper synchronisation of the data
 3. To perform Autoboxing and Unboxing - Java automatically converts primitives to objects(Autoboxing)
                    and
    non primitives to primitives (Unboxing)
